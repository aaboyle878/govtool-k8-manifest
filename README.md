<h><b>Kube Manifest</b></h>  
This repository is a wip example deployment of [Cardano GovTool](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool) for Mainnet  

Current support covers the main components contained with the [Cardano GovTool repo](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool) i.e. Frontend, Backend and Metadata Validation services, and the [Governance Outcomes Pillar](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool-outcomes-pillar)

The Images referenced within this repo are taken from fork of the [Cardano GovTool repo](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool) which can be found [Here](https://github.com/aaboyle878/govtool) and from a fork of the [Governanace Outcomes Pillar](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool-outcomes-pillar) which can be found [Here](https://github.com/aaboyle878/govtool-outcomes-pillar).

This repo has been set-up to allow anyone interseted to clone and deploy their own version of [GovTool](https://gov.tools) using a local minikube cluster with the primary objective of encouraging community involvement with the project and providing a safe playground where anyone can explore the inner working of the application.

There are plans to add support for the other pilliars of the [Govtool](https://gov.tools) i.e, the [Budget Proposal Area](https://gov.tools/budget_discussion), the [Proposal Discussion Forum](https://gov.tools/proposal_discussion)
