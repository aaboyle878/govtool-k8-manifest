This repository is a wip example deployment of [Cardano GovTool](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool) for Mainnet  

Current support covers the main components contained with the [Cardano GovTool](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool) repo i.e. Frontend, Backend and Metadata Validation services.

The Images referenced within this repo are taken from fork of [Cardano GovTool](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool) which can be found [Here](https://github.com/aaboyle878/govtool).

This repo has been set-up to allow anyone interseted to clone and deploy their own version of [GovTool](gov.tools) using a local minikube cluster with the primary objective of encouraging community involvement with the project and providing a safe playground where anyone can explore the inner working of the application.
